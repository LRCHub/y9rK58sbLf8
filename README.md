[00:26.64] Big town, synthetic apparitions of not being lonely
[00:34.19] "Look! He's having a breakdown"
[00:36.37] "Oh, what a let down, a shame, I think he might die!"
[00:42.68] And now she's dancing enthralling
[00:45.18] I guess I gotta wait my turn
[00:50.20] I said, "Don't fall in love with the moment"
[00:53.43] She said I've got a lot to learn
[01:09.43] 
[00:59.27] And you know I'm in love with this city
[01:01.56] But the green is turning brown
[01:03.76] And I just look pathetic now
[01:17.76] 
[01:07.61] If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
[01:10.74] And we're so intelligent (She's American)
[01:15.92] If she says I've got to fix my teeth
[01:18.97] Then she's so American (She's American)
[01:24.01] And if she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
[01:27.05] And we're socially irrelevant (She's American)
[01:32.58] If she says I've got to fix my teeth
[01:35.43] Then she's so American (She's American)
[01:54.93] 
[01:41.89] She's inducing sleep to avoid pain
[01:49.25] And I think she's got a gun divinely decreed and custom made
[01:57.56] She calls on the phone like the old days, expecting the world
[02:05.31] And don't fall in love with the moment
[02:07.98] And think you're in love with the girl
[02:26.98] 
[02:13.77] There's no more water in this city
[02:16.09] But be careful or you'll drown
[02:18.22] You think you've got it figured out
[02:35.72] 
[02:22.30] If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
[02:25.12] And we're so intelligent (She's American)
[02:30.59] If she says I've got to fix my teeth
[02:33.47] Then she's so American (She's American)
[02:38.52] And if she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
[02:41.74] And we're socially irrelevant (She's American)
[02:46.85] If she says I've got to fix my teeth
[02:50.00] Then she's so American (She's American)
[03:09.50] 
[02:59.31] Well, your face has got a hold on me
[03:03.24] But your brain is proper weird, are you feeling the same?
[03:09.60] You just keep nodding at me, looking vacant
[03:31.10] 
[03:25.94] She likes it 'cause we just don't eat
[03:28.62] And we're socially irrelevant
[03:30.37] She's American
[03:33.71] She says I've got to fix my teeth
[03:36.53] Then she's so American
[03:38.62] She's American
[03:45.62] 
[03:40.93] If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
[03:43.71] And we're so intelligent (She's American)
[03:48.84] If she says I've got to fix my teeth
[03:52.28] Then she's so American She's American)
[03:57.20] If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
[04:00.28] And we're socially relevant (She's American)
[04:05.78] If she says I've got to fix my teeth
[04:08.65] Then she's so American (She's American)
